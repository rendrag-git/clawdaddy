# ClawDaddy Brand Voice Guide

> Based on Pearson's actual communication patterns. All marketing, posts, emails, and copy should sound like this — not like a marketing department.

## The 10 Rules

### 1. Lead with the problem, not the product
❌ "ClawDaddy is a revolutionary AI hosting platform..."
✅ "Setting up OpenClaw properly is a pain. I built something to fix that."

Always start with what sucks, then introduce the fix. People connect with the frustration before they care about the solution.

### 2. Use "honestly" and "the thing is" when making your real point
Pearson's pattern: build context → "honestly" → the thing he actually cares about. This signals authenticity. Don't overuse it, but don't sanitize it out either.

✅ "The quiz part is what I'm most proud of honestly."
✅ "The thing is, most of these competitors are just thin VPS wrappers."

### 3. Short sentences. Then a longer one when you're explaining.
The rhythm is: punch, punch, expand. Not uniform sentence length. Not run-on paragraphs. Read it out loud — if you can't say it in one breath, split it.

✅ "BYOK. Bring your own key. You control your API costs."
❌ "We offer a bring-your-own-key model that allows you to maintain full control over your API expenditure."

### 4. No corporate vocabulary
These words are banned:
- leverage, utilize, empower, revolutionize, cutting-edge
- seamless, robust, scalable (unless talking actual architecture)
- "we're excited to announce"
- "at ClawDaddy, we believe..."
- anything that sounds like a press release

Use instead: built, made, fixed, works, does, handles, runs

### 5. Talk like you're explaining to a smart friend
The audience is technical-ish but not necessarily developers. They're smart people who don't need hand-holding but also don't want jargon soup. Explain the "so what" — don't just list features.

❌ "13 AWS Lightsail regions with auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificates"
✅ "Pick your region, get HTTPS on your own subdomain. Takes 5 minutes."

### 6. Be specific with numbers
Pearson uses concrete numbers, not vague claims. This builds trust.

✅ "3-minute quiz, 9 personality dimensions, 5 minutes to a running instance"
✅ "$19/mo, dedicated box, your data stays on your server"
❌ "affordable pricing" or "quick setup" or "enterprise-grade security"

### 7. Acknowledge competitors without trashing them
✅ "Not trying to be the 20th 'we'll host your OpenClaw' wrapper. The onboarding experience is the product."
❌ "Unlike our competitors who offer inferior..."

The flex is in what you built, not in tearing others down.

### 8. End with a clear ask
Every post/email should end with one specific thing you want the reader to do. Not three CTAs. One.

✅ "Looking for 10-15 people who want to try it and tell me what's broken. DM me."
❌ "Sign up for our newsletter, follow us on Twitter, and join our Discord!"

### 9. Bullet points come AFTER the story
Tell the story first in prose. Then use bullets for the concrete list of what they get. Never open with bullets — that's a feature sheet, not a pitch.

### 10. Sound like a person who built something, not a company selling something
This is the meta-rule. Every sentence should pass the test: "Would a real person say this to another person?" If it sounds like it came from a marketing team, rewrite it.

## Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Reddit post | Casual, direct, founder-talking-to-peers |
| Landing page | Slightly more polished but still conversational |
| Email to customers | Warm, brief, helpful — like a text from a friend who happens to run the company |
| Error messages | Human, not robotic — "Something broke. Here's what happened." |
| Documentation | Clear, concise, no personality needed — just be helpful |

## Words Pearson Actually Uses
built, fixed, the thing is, honestly, pain, rabbit hole, works, ships, broken, clean, solid, quick, real, genuine, actually

## Words to Avoid
leverage, utilize, empower, seamless, robust, cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changing, best-in-class, enterprise-grade, next-generation
