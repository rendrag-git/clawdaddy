## 1. Personality-Driven AI Personalization (Priority: Post-Launch)

**Working title:** "Personality-Driven AI Personalization: Mapping Big Five Dimensions to LLM System Prompt Configuration and Measuring User Satisfaction"

**Novel contribution:** Quiz → config → measurable outcome pipeline. Big Five literature exists. LLM prompting literature exists. Nobody's connected them through a real product with real users.

**Data collection (passive, from ClawDaddy usage):**
- Quiz responses (9 dimensions, 12 questions)
- Dimension scores per user
- User satisfaction / retention / engagement metrics
- SOUL.md configs generated

**Validation needed:**
- N ≥ 200 users
- Convergent validity: correlate quiz scores with standard TIPI (10-item Big Five)
- A/B test: quiz-matched config vs. random config → satisfaction delta
- Pre/post: satisfaction before personalization vs. after

**Timeline:** Start collecting data at launch. Write paper at 6 months + 200 users.
