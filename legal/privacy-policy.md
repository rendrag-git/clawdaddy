# Privacy Policy

**ClawDaddy LLC**  
**DRAFT — Not yet reviewed by legal counsel**  
**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

---

## 1. Introduction

ClawDaddy LLC ("ClawDaddy," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our managed hosting services for OpenClaw AI assistants ("Service").

By using our Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**This is a starting-point privacy policy and has not been reviewed by legal counsel. We recommend having it reviewed by a qualified attorney before using it in production.**

---

## 2. What We Do

ClawDaddy provides managed hosting for AI assistants. This means:
- **We host your conversations** with your AI assistant on our infrastructure.
- **We store your data** (messages, configurations, files, and other content you create through the Service).
- **We process your interactions** to deliver the AI assistant functionality.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information You Provide
- **Account Information:** Email address, name, billing information, and payment details.
- **Service Data:** Conversations, messages, files, configurations, and any other content you create, upload, or transmit through your AI assistant.
- **Support Communications:** Messages you send us for customer support or inquiries.

### 3.2 Information We Collect Automatically
- **Usage Data:** Information about how you use the Service, such as access times, features used, and errors encountered.
- **Technical Data:** IP address, browser type, device information, and operating system (only when necessary for Service operation or security).

### 3.3 AI Interaction Data (Fully Managed Tier) <!-- REVIEWER ADDITION: Critical — Tier 3 uses company's API key, meaning conversation data flows through ClawDaddy's account with the AI provider -->
If you use our Fully Managed tier, your AI assistant conversations are transmitted to third-party AI API providers **through ClawDaddy's API credentials**. This means:
- Your conversation data passes through our API account with the AI provider.
- The AI provider may process, log, or retain your conversation data subject to **their** privacy policy and terms of service.
- ClawDaddy does not control and is not responsible for the AI provider's data handling practices.
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the applicable AI provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) for details on how they handle data submitted through their APIs.

For Managed BYOK tier customers, conversations are transmitted using **your own** API credentials, and the AI provider's data handling is governed by your direct relationship with them.

### 3.4 What We DON'T Collect (Currently)
- **We do not use tracking cookies or analytics on our landing page.** We may add privacy-respecting analytics in the future, and we'll update this policy if we do.
- **We do not collect sensitive personal information** unless you voluntarily provide it through your use of the Service.

---

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
- **Provide and operate the Service:** Host your AI assistant, process your requests, and deliver functionality.
- **Maintain and improve the Service:** Fix bugs, optimize performance, and develop new features.
- **Provide customer support:** Respond to your questions and troubleshoot issues.
- **Process payments:** Bill you for the Service and manage your subscription.
- **Comply with legal obligations:** Respond to legal requests or prevent fraud and abuse.

---

## 5. We Don't Read Your Conversations (Except When Necessary)

**Your conversations with your AI assistant are private.** We do not routinely access, read, or monitor your conversations.

**We may access your data only when:**
- **You request support:** If you contact us for help with a technical issue, we may need to review relevant logs or messages to diagnose the problem.
- **Debugging or troubleshooting:** If there's a service issue affecting your account, we may need to inspect data to identify the cause.
- **Security or abuse prevention:** If we detect potential security threats, violations of our Terms of Service, or illegal activity, we may investigate as necessary.
- **Legal requirement:** If required by law, court order, or legal process.

**We will access your data only to the extent necessary and with appropriate safeguards.**

---

## 6. We Don't Sell Your Data

**We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information or conversation data to third parties.** Period.

## 7. How We Share Your Information

We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

### 7.1 Service Providers
We may share data with third-party service providers who help us operate the Service, such as:

These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.

## 8. Data Retention

### 8.1 Active Accounts
We retain your data for as long as your account is active and as necessary to provide the Service.

### 8.2 After Cancellation
**When you cancel your account, your data will be deleted within 30 days.** This includes:

We may retain some data for longer periods if required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., billing records, fraud prevention).

## 9. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including:
- Encryption of data in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Access controls and authentication
