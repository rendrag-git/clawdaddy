## 1. Introduction

ClawDaddy LLC ("ClawDaddy," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our managed hosting services for OpenClaw AI assistants ("Service").

By using our Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, please see Section 12 for additional information about your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**This is a starting-point privacy policy and has not been reviewed by legal counsel. We recommend having it reviewed by a qualified attorney before using it in production.**

## 2. What We Do

ClawDaddy provides managed hosting for AI assistants. This means:
- **We host your conversations** with your AI assistant on our infrastructure.
- **We store your data** (messages, configurations, files, and other content you create through the Service).
- **We process your interactions** to deliver the AI assistant functionality.
- **We offer region-specific hosting** — you select your hosting region (US or EU), and your data stays in that region.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information You Provide
- **Account Information:** Email address, name, billing information, and payment details.
- **Service Data:** Conversations, messages, files, configurations, and any other content you create, upload, or transmit through your AI assistant.

### 3.2 Information We Collect Automatically

- **Technical Data:** IP address, browser type, device information, and operating system (only when necessary for Service operation or security).

### 3.3 AI Interaction Data — Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

ClawDaddy operates on a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. Your AI assistant conversations are transmitted to Anthropic using **your own** API key. This means:
- Your conversation data passes through your own API account with Anthropic.
- Anthropic's data handling is governed by your direct relationship with them and their privacy policy.
- ClawDaddy does not have access to your Anthropic API key beyond what is necessary to route requests on your behalf.

We recommend reviewing [Anthropic's privacy policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) for details on how they handle data submitted through their APIs.

### 3.4 What We DON'T Collect (Currently)
- **We do not use tracking cookies or analytics on our landing page.** We may add privacy-respecting analytics in the future, and we'll update this policy if we do.
- **We do not collect sensitive personal information** unless you voluntarily provide it through your use of the Service.

## 4. Lawful Basis for Processing (EEA/UK Users)

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we process your personal data on the following legal bases under the GDPR:

- **Contract Performance (Art. 6(1)(b)):** Processing necessary to provide the Service you signed up for — hosting your AI assistant, processing your interactions, managing your account.
- **Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f)):** Processing necessary for our legitimate interests, such as improving the Service, ensuring security, preventing fraud, and providing customer support. We balance these interests against your rights and freedoms.
- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):** Where required, we will obtain your consent before processing (e.g., marketing communications, if we add them in the future). You may withdraw consent at any time.
- **Legal Obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)):** Processing necessary to comply with applicable laws, such as tax and accounting requirements or responding to legal requests.

## 6. We Don't Read Your Conversations (Except When Necessary)

**Your conversations with your AI assistant are private.** We do not routinely access, read, or monitor your conversations.

**We may access your data only when:**
- **You request support:** If you contact us for help with a technical issue, we may need to review relevant logs or messages to diagnose the problem.
- **Debugging or troubleshooting:** If there's a service issue affecting your account, we may need to inspect data to identify the cause.
- **Security or abuse prevention:** If we detect potential security threats, violations of our Terms of Service, or illegal activity, we may investigate as necessary.
