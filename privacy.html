          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">ClawDaddy LLC ("ClawDaddy," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our managed hosting services for OpenClaw AI assistants ("Service").</p>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">By using our Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="text-zinc-300"><strong>This is a starting-point privacy policy and has not been reviewed by legal counsel. We recommend having it reviewed by a qualified attorney before using it in production.</strong></p>

          <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-white">2. What We Do</h2>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">ClawDaddy provides managed hosting for AI assistants. This means:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li><strong>We host your conversations</strong> with your AI assistant on our infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>We store your data</strong> (messages, configurations, files, and other content you create through the Service).</li>
            <li><strong>We process your interactions</strong> to deliver the AI assistant functionality.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-white">3. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3 class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-white">3.1 Information You Provide</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address, name, billing information, and payment details.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Data:</strong> Conversations, messages, files, configurations, and any other content you create, upload, or transmit through your AI assistant.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> Messages you send us for customer support or inquiries.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-white">3.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the Service, such as access times, features used, and errors encountered.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, browser type, device information, and operating system (only when necessary for Service operation or security).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-white">3.3 AI Interaction Data (Fully Managed Tier)</h3>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">If you use our Fully Managed tier, your AI assistant conversations are transmitted to third-party AI API providers <strong>through ClawDaddy's API credentials</strong>. This means:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li>Your conversation data passes through our API account with the AI provider.</li>
            <li>The AI provider may process, log, or retain your conversation data subject to <strong>their</strong> privacy policy and terms of service.</li>
            <li>ClawDaddy does not control and is not responsible for the AI provider's data handling practices.</li>
            <li>We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the applicable AI provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) for details on how they handle data submitted through their APIs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-zinc-300">For Managed BYOK tier customers, conversations are transmitted using <strong>your own</strong> API credentials, and the AI provider's data handling is governed by your direct relationship with them.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-white">3.4 What We DON'T Collect (Currently)</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li><strong>We do not use tracking cookies or analytics on our landing page.</strong> We may add privacy-respecting analytics in the future, and we'll update this policy if we do.</li>
            <li><strong>We do not collect sensitive personal information</strong> unless you voluntarily provide it through your use of the Service.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-white">4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

          <p class="text-zinc-300"><strong>Your conversations with your AI assistant are private.</strong> We do not routinely access, read, or monitor your conversations.</p>
          <p class="text-zinc-300"><strong>We may access your data only when:</strong></p>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-zinc-300">
            <li><strong>You request support:</strong> If you contact us for help with a technical issue, we may need to review relevant logs or messages to diagnose the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging or troubleshooting:</strong> If there's a service issue affecting your account, we may need to inspect data to identify the cause.</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-zinc-300"><strong>We will access your data only to the extent necessary and with appropriate safeguards.</strong></p>

          <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-white">6. We Don't Sell Your Data</h2>
          <p class="text-zinc-300"><strong>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information or conversation data to third parties.</strong> Period.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-white">7. How We Share Your Information</h2>
